## My First-Hour Priorities

* Capture all data associated with Sam Rivera
* Look at any information associated with the same IP adresses
* Look at any related actions taken by those IP adresses

## Integrity & Privacy Controls

###### Making sure that data is stored in a secure way is one of the most crucial elements of maintaining secure and private data collection.  Making sure to redact all data that isn't important to the investigation is crucial to making sure that no major issues arise when the data needs to be looked at and passed around during an incident.  Furthermore giving someone a hash as well as the redacted data helps to make sure that no issues arise with the data being modified in transfer.  

## Reflection

###### The major tradeoff with the way that the data is handled, is that we do need to see the name of the person who was primarally affected.  You could block out Sam Rivera in the same way as everyone else but if there is more than one Sam that was trying to log onto the network at the same time you end up with a major problem that can't address without revealing who it is.  The logs need to contain his full name in order for them to be useful.  Alternatively uncencoring everyones name is pointless, we care about what is happening with Sam and that is what was authorized and nothing else.
