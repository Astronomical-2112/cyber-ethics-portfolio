## ROE Outline

#### Purpose and Approvals 

* The Chief Information Officer (CIO) must sign off on the written approval for any testing to take place

* Any approved tests must be done within a specified date and time 

* The target of the test must be specified within the approval. 

#### Scope 

* The Scope is defined by the CIO in the written approval message 

* The test should be as focused and narrow as possible.

#### Timing & deconfliction

* The time and date of the test is determined primarily by the type of test that is occurring

* The windows of time should be explicitly defined in the written approval

* Generally the test will be conducted when the service is least active to minimize any issues that could come from the test occurring

#### Communications & escalation

* Communication between all parties involved is paramount to make sure that the pen test goes smoothly 

* Backups of all systems being tested should be made

* Conditions should be set for the test to be stopped

#### Data handling

* Minimal data should be collected during the testing process

* All Personally identifiable information should be redacted

* The stored data should be encrypted

#### Reporting & handoff

* A report should be drafted and sent within 5 business days

* The data should be hashed and transported as securely as possible

* The contents of the report should contain all of the technical details that were agreed upon when the CIO signed off on the test to occur

## Consent/Authorization Snippet

###### [Name of tester] have been granted permission to examine the organizations' networks to find vulnerabilities.  They have been granted the authority from [Name of CIO], from [start time] to [end time] on [date].

## Escalation Contacts

#### Roles

###### Everyone involved with the service being tested should be in the know about what is happening.  

#### Contact windows

###### Once the contact window ends, the test should be over.  

#### Stop-test trigger 

###### The test should have parameters set before the test begins that limit how long the test goes on for.

## Reflection 

###### While I understand the importance of maintaining a narrow scope, attackers when presented with the option will frequently go off and take whatever advantage they can.  Limiting of scope can in some cases make it harder to properly simulate an attack on a service.
