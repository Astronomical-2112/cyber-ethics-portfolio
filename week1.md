## Ethical Lenses

Humanism is an ethical framework that grounds itself in the idea of maximizing human potential.  In order to maximize human potential, we need to make sure that systems in society are fair, equal, and designed with people in mind.
I personally beleive that Humanism is one of the most important things to discuss when talking about technical systems.  Taking people into consideration is good and an important thing to do when building anything from tax software to social media websites, and I think we would all benefit more if we would consider each other when designing society.

## Authorization Principle

    Authorization Principle is the guiding principle that you use for determining who should and shouldn't have access to certain types of information or data.  For example, the system that the FBI uses to determine who has access to certain types of privlaged information.  

## Policy Snippet

	The use of our labâ€™s equipment is limited only to authorized individuals using the equipment for explicitly defined instructional purposes.  Evasion of implemented security measures will lead to consequences.  Data is collected on every individual user who has been granted access to the supplied equipment.  Uses defined outside of what you are explicitly allowed to do, including collection of data outside of what is expressly allowed, attempting to access networks or servers you have not been given permission to use, or any other action not permitted can lead to loss of access, and disciplinary action.  Any forms of illegal activity committed with the equipment can lead to potential legal action, in addition to disciplinary action and revocation of the privilege to access the systems.
