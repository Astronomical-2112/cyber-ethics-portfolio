## Principles Summary

#### Notice/Consent:
###### Informing the user that data will be collected, and either letting them opt out, or informing them before they start using your service.

#### Purpose Limitation:
###### Limiting the ways that the collected data can be used, for example only using the location data in a search engine to let a user know what stores are nearby and not storing that data in a way that can be used.

#### Data Minimization:
###### Limiting the data collected down to only what is absolutely nessessary for the service to work on the consumers end. 

#### Proportionality:
###### The collected data must be relevant and necessary to the project that you are working on, and nothing else.


## My Monitoring & Retention Clause

###### “Hocking College monitors the schools network to protect operations and comply with policy. Monitoring is limited only to authorized purposes and assigned scope laid out in the Accepted Use Policy. Users receive notice at sign-in and through the Accepted Use Policy, and are required to accept it before use of the network; personal communications are not reviewed except as required by law or incident response.  Hocking College minimized the total amount of data collected.  Only limited to any network use that is either illegal or against the schools Accepted Use Policy.  Hocking College also restricts access only to trained staff, and retains monitoring data for 30 days unless required longer for investigations or legal holds. Individuals may raise concerns or appeal via email. Violations may result in loss of access and disciplinary action.”


## Justification

###### I wrote the monitoring and retention clause primarally with data minimization in mind.  The clause was written about the exceptions to the general rule that network administrators should not be looking through everything you are doing unless it is something that is actually important for them to stop.  Such as anything illegal or defined as against the rules in a clear mannor.  The user is also put on notice by definition of reading the clause, they will have full knowledge of all information that will be collected about them.

## Reflection 

###### Looking at my retention clause now, I absoutely leaned way harder on the template then I really should have.  There is a balance act between being too verbose that no one wants to read it and no one knows what the rules are, often what is seen in modern tech, primarally as a feature instead of a bug.  But if you don't elaborate enough no one knows what the rules are and that also really sucks.
